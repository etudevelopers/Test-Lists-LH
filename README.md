# Test Lists — Learning Hour

A [Learning Hour] on writing test lists before coding: what they are, why they help, and a checklist for a
well-formed test list item.

This repository is generated from the [learning-hour-template] and includes:

- A [Jekyll] site configured with the [Just the Docs] theme, located in the `site` folder
- A copy of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-4.0) in the
  repository root. This license applies to all site documentation content
- A [GitHub Actions workflow] in the `.github/workflows` folder to build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages
- A Notice file for third-party attributions in the repository root

## Getting started

1. Go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions to serve the `site` folder
2. See [site/index.md](site/index.md) for the Learning Hour agenda

## GitHub Actions Workflows

- **Site Deployment:** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages.

## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1. Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

Alternatively, run `./site/start_local_server.sh` from anywhere in the repository. It installs any missing
gem dependencies and serves the site with live reload at `localhost:4000`.

The built site is stored in the directory `site/_site`.
